# Basic Calculator in Python

This is a simple calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
* Basic error handling for division by zero.

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure Python is installed:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2.  **Save the code:** Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `calculator.py`).
3.  **Run from the command line:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then, run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    basicalc.py
    ```

## Usage

1.  The program will prompt you to enter the first number.
2.  Then, it will ask you to enter the operator (+, -, \*, /).
3.  Finally, it will ask you to enter the second number.
4.  The program will display the result of the calculation.
5. The program will loop and ask for new inputs until the program is closed.

## Example
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0


## Code Structure

The code is organized into a single Python file. It uses `if` and `elif` statements to determine the operation to perform. It also includes a check to prevent division by zero.

## Potential Improvements

* Adding more advanced operations (e.g., exponents, square roots).
* Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
* Adding more comprehensive error handling for invalid input.
* Adding memory functions.
* Adding ability to use previous result in the next operation.
